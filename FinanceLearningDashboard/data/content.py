                The Sharma family purchases a family floater health insurance policy with a coverage of ₹5 lakhs for ₹20,000 annual premium. When Mrs. Sharma requires hospitalization for surgery costing ₹3 lakhs, the insurance company settles the claim directly with the hospital through cashless facility, after a deductible of ₹10,000 paid by the family.

                "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
                "content": """
                **1. What is the difference between term and whole life insurance?**
                Term insurance provides coverage for a specific period, with no maturity benefit if you survive the term. Whole life insurance provides lifetime coverage with a savings component, resulting in higher premiums but offering maturity benefits.

                **2. How much life insurance coverage do I need?**
                A general rule is 10-15 times your annual income, but the exact amount depends on your financial obligations, outstanding debts, future expenses (like children's education), and family needs.

                **3. Can I have multiple health insurance policies?**
                Yes, you can have multiple health insurance policies. In case of a claim, you can use one policy first and then claim the remaining amount from another policy (subject to contribution clause).

                **4. What is a pre-existing condition in health insurance?**
                A pre-existing condition is a health condition or illness that existed before you purchased the health insurance policy. Most policies have a waiting period of 2-4 years before covering pre-existing conditions.

                **5. What is a claim settlement ratio?**
                The claim settlement ratio is the percentage of claims settled by an insurance company out of the total claims received during a financial year. A higher ratio indicates better claim settlement practices.

                **6. What is a grace period in insurance?**
                The grace period is an additional time given after the premium due date during which you can pay the premium without the policy lapsing. Typically, it's 15-30 days for most policies.

                **7. How do insurance companies calculate premiums?**
                Premiums are calculated based on risk assessment factors including age, health condition, coverage amount, policy term, occupation, lifestyle habits, and sometimes family medical history.

                **8. Can insurance claims be rejected?**
                Yes, claims can be rejected for reasons such as non-disclosure of material facts, policy exclusions, fraudulent claims, lapsed policies, or claims filed outside the policy period.

                "content": """
                **1. What is the minimum amount needed to start investing in equity?**
                With direct equity investments, you can start with as little as the price of one share, which could be as low as ₹10. Through mutual funds, you can start SIPs with as little as ₹500 per month.

                **2. How risky is equity investment compared to other asset classes?**
                Equity is generally considered higher risk compared to fixed income, but it also offers higher potential returns. The risk can be managed through diversification and a long-term investment horizon.

                **3. What is the difference between stocks and mutual funds?**
                Stocks represent direct ownership in a specific company, while mutual funds pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, managed by professional fund managers.

                **4. How do dividends work?**
                Dividends are a portion of a company's profits distributed to shareholders. They can be received as cash or reinvested to buy additional shares through dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).

                **5. What is the difference between primary and secondary markets?**
                The primary market is where new securities are issued and sold for the first time (like IPOs), while the secondary market is where existing securities are traded among investors.

                **6. How important is timing the market?**
                While timing can affect returns, consistent investments over time (like through SIPs) often outperform attempts to time the market, as it's extremely difficult to consistently predict market movements.

                **7. What should I look for in a company before investing?**
                Key factors include financial health (profitability, debt levels), management quality, competitive advantages, growth prospects, industry outlook, and valuation relative to peers.

                **8. How are equity mutual funds categorized?**
                Equity mutual funds are typically categorized by market capitalization (large, mid, small-cap), investment style (growth, value, blend), sector focus, or geographical focus (domestic, international).

                **2. What is the difference between discretionary and non-discretionary PMS?**
                In discretionary PMS, the portfolio manager makes all investment decisions without client consultation. In non-discretionary PMS, the manager provides recommendations but requires client approval before executing transactions.

                **3. How liquid are PMS and AIF investments?**
                PMS typically offers better liquidity with notice periods ranging from 7-30 days, though some strategies may have lock-in periods. AIFs usually have longer lock-ins (3-10 years depending on category and strategy) with limited or no interim liquidity.

                **4. Are returns guaranteed in PMS or AIF?**
                No, SEBI regulations explicitly prohibit guaranteed returns in PMS and AIF. Any investment manager promising guaranteed returns is violating regulations. All investments are subject to market risks.

                **5. How are PMS and AIF returns taxed?**
                PMS investments are taxed based on the underlying assets (equity or debt) with relevant holding period criteria. Category I and II AIFs have pass-through status, while Category III AIF taxation depends on the nature of income generated.

                **6. Can NRIs invest in PMS and AIF?**
                Yes, NRIs can invest in PMS and AIF subject to FEMA regulations and remittance rules. However, they need to comply with additional documentation requirements and may face different tax implications.

                **7. How is investor money protected in PMS and AIF?**
                Client securities in PMS are held directly in the client's name. In AIFs, assets are held by the fund in a segregated manner from the manager's assets. Both are regulated by SEBI with strict compliance requirements to protect investor interests.

                **8. What happens if a PMS provider or AIF manager shuts down?**
                In case of PMS, since securities are held in the client's name, they would be transferred back to the client or to another manager as instructed. For AIFs, there are specific provisions in regulations and fund documents addressing manager change or fund wind-up procedures.

                "content": """
                **1. How do I start investing in stocks?**
                To start investing in stocks, you need to: 1) Open a demat and trading account with a registered broker; 2) Complete KYC verification by providing identity and address proof; 3) Link your bank account for fund transfers; 4) Study the basics of stock investing through books, courses or online resources; 5) Start with small investments in established companies until you gain experience.

                **2. What is the minimum amount needed to invest in stocks?**
                You can start investing in stocks with as little as the price of one share, which could be as low as ₹10 for some stocks. However, it's advisable to have at least ₹5,000-10,000 to build a small, diversified portfolio. Remember that brokerage and other charges can impact returns on very small investments.

                **3. How do I pick good stocks?**
                Picking good stocks involves: 1) Researching company fundamentals, including financial health, competitive advantages, and growth prospects; 2) Analyzing industry trends and company's position within the industry; 3) Evaluating valuation metrics like P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and dividend yield; 4) Checking management quality and corporate governance; 5) Having a clear investment thesis for why you expect the stock to perform well.

                **4. What's the difference between investing and trading?**
                Investing involves buying stocks for the long term (months to years) based on company fundamentals and growth prospects, with the goal of capital appreciation and dividend income. Trading focuses on short-term price movements (minutes to weeks), often using technical analysis, with the goal of profiting from price volatility. Investing typically involves lower transaction frequency and costs, while trading requires more active market monitoring.

                **5. How are stock market gains taxed in India?**
                Stock market gains are taxed as capital gains in India. For equity shares and equity-oriented mutual funds: Short-term capital gains (held for less than 12 months) are taxed at 15%. Long-term capital gains (held for more than 12 months) exceeding ₹1 lakh in a financial year are taxed at 10% without indexation. Additionally, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) is levied on all transactions.

                **6. What are blue-chip stocks?**
                Blue-chip stocks are shares of large, well-established, financially sound companies with a history of reliable performance and dividend payments. These companies typically have stable earnings, strong balance sheets, and are often market leaders in their sectors. Examples in India include HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, TCS, and Hindustan Unilever. They are considered relatively lower-risk equity investments.

                **7. How do circuit breakers work in the stock market?**
                Circuit breakers are automatic mechanisms that temporarily halt trading when market indices fall by certain percentages. In India, they are triggered at three levels: 10%, 15%, and 20% movements in either direction. When triggered, trading stops for a specified time period (15 minutes, 45 minutes, or the remainder of the day), allowing investors to reassess their strategies and preventing panic-driven market crashes.

                **8. What is the difference between primary and secondary market?**
                The primary market is where new securities are issued and sold for the first time, such as in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) where companies raise capital directly from investors. The secondary market is where existing securities are bought and sold among investors after issuance, like the regular trading that occurs on stock exchanges. The primary market creates new securities, while the secondary market provides liquidity for existing ones.

                "content": """
                **1. How do interest rate changes affect bond prices?**
                Bond prices move inversely to interest rates. When interest rates rise, existing bond prices fall because newer bonds offer higher yields. Conversely, when interest rates fall, existing bond prices rise as they become more attractive with their higher coupon rates. This relationship is stronger for longer-term bonds and measured by a bond's duration.

                **2. What's the difference between coupon rate and yield to maturity?**
                The coupon rate is the fixed interest payment as a percentage of a bond's face value, set when the bond is issued. Yield to maturity (YTM) is the total return expected if the bond is held until maturity, considering the current market price, coupon payments, time to maturity, and the difference between purchase price and face value. YTM changes with market conditions while coupon rate remains fixed.

                **3. Are government bonds risk-free?**
                Government bonds, especially those issued by the central government (G-Secs in India), are considered the lowest-risk debt instruments as they're backed by the sovereign's ability to tax and print currency. However, they're not entirely risk-free. They still carry interest rate risk (price fluctuates with rate changes), inflation risk (erosion of purchasing power), and for some countries, default risk (though minimal for stable economies like India).

                **4. How do I invest in government securities in India?**
                Retail investors can invest in government securities through: 1) RBI Retail Direct platform, which allows direct purchase from primary auctions and secondary market; 2) Gilt mutual funds that invest primarily in government securities; 3) Stock exchanges through aggregators/brokers; 4) Non-Competitive Bidding in primary auctions through banks. The minimum investment is typically ₹10,000 and in multiples thereof.

                **5. What are the tax benefits of bonds?**
                Certain bonds offer tax benefits in India: 1) Tax-Free Bonds: Interest income is completely exempt from tax (issued by entities like NHAI, REC, PFC); 2) Capital Gains Tax Benefits: Long-term capital gains on listed bonds are taxed at lower rates (10% without indexation or 20% with indexation); 3) Section 80CCF Benefits: When available, infrastructure bonds offer tax deduction up to specified limits; 4) Sovereign Gold Bonds: Capital gains at maturity are tax-exempt.

                **6. What are credit ratings and how do they affect bond investments?**
                Credit ratings are assessments of a bond issuer's ability to pay interest and repay principal on time. In India, ratings are provided by agencies like CRISIL, ICRA, and CARE. Higher ratings (AAA, AA) indicate lower default risk and typically lower yields, while lower ratings (BB, B, C) suggest higher risk and higher yields. Ratings help investors evaluate risk-return tradeoffs and make informed investment decisions.

                **7. How do inflation-indexed bonds work?**
                Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) or Inflation-Linked Bonds protect investors from inflation by adjusting the principal amount based on inflation rates. In India, these are linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As inflation rises, the principal amount increases, resulting in higher interest payments (since coupon is applied to the adjusted principal). At maturity, investors receive the inflation-adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is higher.

                **8. What is the difference between callable and putable bonds?**
                Callable bonds give the issuer the right to redeem the bonds before maturity at predetermined prices and dates. This benefits issuers when interest rates fall, allowing them to refinance at lower rates. Putable bonds give investors the right to sell the bonds back to the issuer before maturity at predetermined prices. This benefits investors when interest rates rise, allowing them to reinvest at higher rates. Callable bonds typically offer higher yields than non-callable bonds, while putable bonds usually offer lower yields.
